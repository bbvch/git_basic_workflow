# Agile Values

Manifesto for Agile Software Development

## Preamble
We are uncovering better ways of developing
software by doing it and helping others do it.
Through this work we have come to value:

## Values
1. Individuals and interactions over processes and tools
2. Working software over comprehensive documentation
3. Customer collaboration over contract negotiation
4. Responding to change over following a plan

## Coda
That is, while there is value in the items on
the right, we value the items on the left more.
